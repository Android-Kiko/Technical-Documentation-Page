            iOS is the operating system for iPhone, iPad and other Apple mobile devices. 
            Based on Mac OS, the operating system which runs Apple’s line of Mac desktop 
            and laptop computers, Apple iOS is designed for easy, seamless networking 
            between Apple products.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            iOS is the second-most popular mobile computing platform. In September 2017, 
            Apple iOS held a 32 percent share of the mobile market, second only to 
            Android which held a 65.5 percent share.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first version of iOS was released in June 2007, when the iPhone debuted 
            on the market.1 iOS, an acronym for iPhone Operating System, is a Unix-based 
            operating system powering all of Apple’s mobile devices, but the name iOS 
            was not officially applied to the software until 2008, when Apple released 
            the iPhone software development kit (SDK), enabling any app makers to create 
            applications for the platform.2 The overwhelming popularity of the iPhone was 
            certainly driven by the effectiveness of iOS. Nearly 218 million iPhones were 
            sold by the end of 2018, making the device the single most successful product 
            ever released into the market.3﻿ Some estimates show that since launch in 2007, 
            iOS has been responsible for more than $1 trillion in revenue for Apple.

        <article>
          <li>In 2005, when Steve Jobs began planning the iPhone, he had a choice to either 
            "shrink the Mac, which would be an epic feat of engineering, or enlarge the iPod". 
            Jobs favored the former approach but pitted the Macintosh and iPod teams, led by 
            Scott Forstall and Tony Fadell, respectively, against each other in an internal 
            competition, with Forstall winning by creating the iPhone OS. The decision enabled 
            the success of the iPhone as a platform for third-party developers: using a well-known 
            desktop operating system as its basis allowed the many third-party Mac developers 
            to write software for the iPhone with minimal retraining. Forstall was also responsible 
            for creating a software development kit for programmers to build iPhone apps, as well 
            as an App Store within iTunes.</li>

          <li>The operating system was unveiled with the iPhone at the Macworld Conference & Expo 
            on January 9, 2007, and released in June of that year. At the time of its 
            unveiling in January, Steve Jobs claimed: "iPhone runs OS X" and runs "desktop class 
            applications", but at the time of the iPhone's release, the operating system 
            was renamed "iPhone OS". Initially, third-party native applications were not supported. 
            Jobs' reasoning was that developers could build web applications through the Safari web 
            browser that "would behave like native apps on the iPhone". In October 2007, 
            Apple announced that a native Software Development Kit (SDK) was under development and 
            that they planned to put it "in developers' hands in February". On March 6, 
            2008, Apple held a press event, announcing the iPhone SDK.</li>
            
          <li>iPhone (first generation), the first commercially released device running iOS (2007)
            The iOS App Store was opened on July 10, 2008 with an initial 500 applications available.
             This quickly grew to 3,000 in September 2008, 15,000 in January 2009, 50,000 in 
             June 2009, 100,000 in November 2009, 250,000 in August 2010, 650,000 
             in July 2012, 1 million in October 2013, 2 million in June 2016, 
             and 2.2 million in January 2017. As of March 2016, 1 million apps are natively 
             compatible with the iPad tablet computer. These apps have collectively been downloaded 
             more than 130 billion times. App intelligence firm Sensor Tower has estimated that 
             the App Store will reach 5 million apps by the year 2020.</li>
            
            <li>In September 2007, Apple announced the iPod Touch, a redesigned iPod based on the 
              iPhone form factor. On January 27, 2010, Apple introduced their much-anticipated 
              media tablet, the iPad, featuring a larger screen than the iPhone and iPod Touch, and 
              designed for web browsing, media consumption, and reading, and offering multi-touch 
              interaction with multimedia formats including newspapers, e-books, photos, videos, music, 
              word processing documents, video games, and most existing iPhone apps using a 9.7-inch 
              screen. It also includes a mobile version of Safari for web browsing, as 
              well as access to the App Store, iTunes Library, iBookstore, Contacts, and Notes. 
              Content is downloadable via Wi-Fi and optional 3G service or synced through the user's 
              computer. AT&T was initially the sole U.S. provider of 3G wireless access for the iPad.</li>
            
            <li>In June 2010, Apple rebranded iPhone OS as "iOS". The trademark "IOS" had been used by 
              Cisco for over a decade for its operating system, IOS, used on its routers. To avoid any 
              potential lawsuit, Apple licensed the "IOS" trademark from Cisco.</li>
            
            <li>The Apple Watch smartwatch was announced by Tim Cook on September 9, 2014, being 
            introduced as a product with health and fitness-tracking. It was released on 
            April 24, 2015. It uses watchOS as operative system, which is based on IOS:</li>
            
            <li>In October 2016, Apple opened its first iOS Developer Academy in Naples inside University 
            of Naples Federico II's new campus. The course is completely free, aimed at acquiring 
            specific technical skills on the creation and management of applications for the Apple 
            ecosystem platforms. At the Academy there are also issues of business administration 
            (business planning and business management with a focus on digital opportunities) and 
            there is a path dedicated to the design of graphical interfaces. Students have the opportunity 
            to participate in the "Enterprise Track", an in-depth training experience on the entire life 
            cycle of an app, from design to implementation, to security, troubleshooting, data storage 
            and cloud usage. As of 2020, the Academy graduated almost a thousand students from 
            all over the world, who have worked on 400 app ideas and have already published about 50 apps 
            on the iOS App Store. In the 2018/2019 academic year, students from more than 30 different 
            countries arrived. 35 of these have been selected to attend the Worldwide Developer Conference, 
            the annual Apple Developer Conference held annually in California in early June.</li>
            
            <li>Steve Jobs, Apple's then CEO, introducing the iPad.
            On June 3, 2019, iPadOS, the branded version of iOS for iPad, was announced at the 2019 WWDC; 
            it was launched on September 25, 2019.</li>

          <p>The iOS SDK (Software Development Kit) allows for the development of mobile apps on iOS.</p>
          <p>While originally developing iPhone prior to its unveiling in 2007, Apple's then-CEO Steve 
            Jobs did not intend to let third-party developers build native apps for iOS, instead directing 
            them to make web applications for the Safari web browser. However, backlash from developers 
            prompted the company to reconsider, with Jobs announcing in October 2007 that Apple would 
            have a software development kit available for developers by February 2008. The SDK 
            was released on March 6, 2008.</p>
          <p>The SDK is a free download for users of Mac personal computers. It is not available 
            for Microsoft Windows PCs. The SDK contains sets giving developers access to various 
            functions and services of iOS devices, such as hardware and software attributes.   It 
            also contains an iPhone simulator to mimic the look and feel of the device on the computer 
            while developing. New versions of the SDK accompany new versions of iOS. In 
            order to test applications, get technical support, and distribute apps through App Store, 
            developers are required to subscribe to the Apple Developer Program.</p>
          <p>Combined with Xcode, the iOS SDK helps developers write iOS apps using officially 
            supported programming languages, including Swift and Objective-C. Other 
            companies have also created tools that allow for the development of native iOS 
            apps using their respective programming languages.</p>

          <p>You can find the current version of iOS on your iPhone in the "General" section of your phone's 
          Settings app. Tap "Software Update" to see your current iOS version and to check if there are any 
          new system updates waiting to be installed. You can also find the iOS version on the "About" 
          page in the "General" section.</p>
          <p>iOS is used on the iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, iPod Nano, and Apple TV. There is an on going trend 
            to merge iOS with Mac OS X. In the Apple store over a million Apps are available for the iPhone, 
            and over five hundred thousand Apps are optimized for the iPad.</p>

        <p>The main hardware platform for iOS is the ARM architecture (the ARMv7, ARMv8-A, ARMv8.2-A, ARMv8.3-A). 
          iOS releases before iOS 7 can only be run on iOS devices with 32-bit ARM processors (ARMv6 and ARMv7-A 
          architectures). In 2013, iOS 7 was released with full 64-bit support (which includes a native 64-bit 
          kernel, libraries, drivers as well as all built-in applications), after Apple announced that they 
          were switching to 64-bit ARMv8-A processors with the introduction of the Apple A7 chip. 64-bit 
          support was also enforced for all apps in the App Store; All new apps submitted to the App Store with 
          a deadline of February 2015, and all app updates submitted to the App Store with a deadline of June 1, 
          2015. iOS 11 drops support for all iOS devices with 32-bit ARM processors as well as 32-bit 
          applications, making iOS 64-bit only.</p>

          <h2><b>Market share</b></h2>
          <p>iOS is the second most popular mobile operating system in the world, 
            after Android. Sales of iPads in recent years are also behind Android, 
            while, by web use (a proxy for all use), iPads (using iOS) are still the 
            most popular.</p>

          <p>By the middle of 2012, there were 410 million devices activated.
            At WWDC 2014, Tim Cook said 800 million devices had been sold by June 2014.</p>
          
          <p>During Apple's quarterly earnings call in January 2015, the company 
            announced that they had sold over one billion iOS devices since 2007.</p>
          
          <p>By late 2011, iOS accounted for 60% of the market share for smartphones and 
            tablets. By the end of 2014, iOS accounted for 14.8% of the smartphone market 
            and 27.6% of the tablet and two-in-one market. In February 2015, StatCounter 
            reported iOS was used on 23.18% of smartphones and 66.25% of tablets worldwide, 
            measured by internet usage instead of sales.</p>
          
          <p>In the third quarter of 2015, research from Strategy Analytics showed that 
            iOS adoption of the worldwide smartphone market was at a record low 12.1%, 
            attributed to lackluster performance in China and Africa. Android accounted 
            for 87.5% of the market, with Windows Phone and BlackBerry accounting for the 
            rest.</p>

        <article>
          <p>iOS utilizes many security features in both hardware and software. Below are summaries of the 
            most prominent features.</p>

          </h3></b>Secure Boot</h2></b>
          <p>Before fully booting into iOS, there is low-level code that runs from the Boot ROM. Its task is to 
          verify that the Low-Level Bootloader is signed by the Apple Root CA public key before running it. 
          This process is to ensure that no malicious or otherwise unauthorized software can be run on an iOS 
          device. After the Low-Level Bootloader finishes its tasks, it runs the higher level bootloader, known 
          as iBoot. If all goes well, iBoot will then proceed to load the iOS kernel as well as the rest of 
          the operating system.</p>

          </h3></b>Secure Enclave</h3></b>
          <p>The Secure Enclave is a coprocessor found in iOS devices part of the A7 and newer chips used for 
          data protection, Touch ID and Face ID. The purpose of the Secure Enclave is to handle keys and other 
          info such as biometrics that is sensitive enough to not be handled by the Application Processor (AP). 
          It is isolated with a hardware filter so the AP cannot access it. It shares RAM with the AP, but its 
          portion of the RAM (known as TZ0) is encrypted. The secure enclave itself is a flashable 4MB AKF processor 
          core called the secure enclave processor (SEP) as documented in Apple Patent Application 20130308838. 
          The technology used is similar to ARM's TrustZone/SecurCore but contains proprietary code for Apple KF 
          cores in general and SEP specifically. It is also responsible for generating the UID key on A9 or newer 
          chips that protects user data at rest.</p>
          <p>It has its own secure boot process to ensure that it is completely secure. A hardware random number 
          generator is also included as a part of this coprocessor. Each device's Secure Enclave has a unique ID 
          that is given to it when it is made and cannot be changed. This identifier is used to create a temporary 
          key that encrypts the memory in this portion of the system. The Secure Enclave also contains an anti-replay 
          counter to prevent brute force attacks.</p>

          <h3><b>Face ID</h3></b>
          <p>Face ID is a face scanner that is embedded in the notch on iPhone models X, XS, XS Max, XR, 11, 11 Pro, 
          11 Pro Max, 12, 12 Mini, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max. It can be used to unlock the device, make purchases, and 
          log into applications among other functions. When used, Face ID only temporarily stores the face data in 
          encrypted memory in the Secure Enclave, as described below. There is no way for the device's main processor 
          or any other part of the system to access the raw data that is obtained from the Face ID sensor.</p>

          <h3></b>Passcode</h3></b>
          <p>OS devices can have a passcode that is used to unlock the device, make changes to system settings, and encrypt 
          the device's contents. Until recently, these were typically four numerical digits long. However, since unlocking 
          the devices with a fingerprint by using Touch ID has become more widespread, six-digit passcodes are now the default 
          on iOS with the option to switch back to four or use an alphanumeric passcode.[206]</p>

          <h3><b>Touch ID</h3></b>
          <p>Touch ID is a fingerprint scanner that is embedded in the home button and can be used to unlock the device, 
          make purchases, and log into applications among other functions. When used, Touch ID only temporarily stores the 
          fingerprint data in encrypted memory in the Secure Enclave, as described above. There is no way for the device's 
          main processor or any other part of the system to access the raw fingerprint data that is obtained from the Touch 
          ID sensor.</p>

          <h3><b>Address Space Layout Randomization</h3></b>
          <p>Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is a low-level technique of preventing memory corruption attacks 
          such as buffer overflows. It involves placing data in randomly selected locations in memory in order to make it 
          more difficult to predict ways to corrupt the system and create exploits. ASLR makes app bugs more likely to 
          crash the app than to silently overwrite memory, regardless of whether the behavior is accidental or malicious.</p>

          <h3><b>Non-Executable Memory</h3></b>
          <p>iOS utilizes the ARM architecture's Execute Never (XN) feature. This allows some portions of the memory to be 
          marked as non-executable, working alongside ASLR to prevent buffer overflow attacks including return-to-libc attacks.</p>

          <h3><b>Encryption</h3></b>
          <p>As mentioned above, one use of encryption in iOS is in the memory of the Secure Enclave. When a passcode is 
          utilized on an iOS device, the contents of the device are encrypted. This is done by using a hardware AES 256 
          implementation that is very efficient because it is placed directly between the flash storage and RAM.</p>
          <p>iOS, in combination with its specific hardware, uses crypto-shredding when erasing all content and 
          settings by obliterating all the keys in 'effaceable storage'. This renders all user data on the device 
          cryptographically inaccessible.</p>

          <h3><b>Keychain</h3></b>
          <p>The iOS keychain is a database of login information that can be shared across apps written by the same person 
          or organization. This service is often used for storing passwords for web applications.</p>

          <h3><b>App Security</h3></b>
          <p>Third-party applications such as those distributed through the App Store must be code signed with an Apple-issued 
          certificate. In principle, this continues the chain of trust all the way from the Secure Boot process as mentioned above 
          to the actions of the applications installed on the device by users. Applications are also sandboxed, meaning that they 
          can only modify the data within their individual home directory unless explicitly given permission to do otherwise. For 
          example, they cannot access data that is owned by other user-installed applications on the device. There is a very extensive 
          set of privacy controls contained within iOS with options to control apps' ability to access a wide variety of permissions 
          such as the camera, contacts, background app refresh, cellular data, and access to other data and services. Most of the code 
          in iOS, including third-party applications, runs as the "mobile" user which does not have root privileges. This ensures that 
          system files and other iOS system resources remain hidden and inaccessible to user-installed applications.</p>
          
          <h3><b>App Store bypasses</h3></b>
          <p>Companies can apply to Apple for enterprise developer certificates. These can be used to sign apps such that iOS will 
          install them directly (sometimes called "sideloading"), without the app needing to be distributed via the App Store. 
          The terms under which they are granted make clear that they are only to be used for companies who wish to distribute apps 
          directly to their employees.</p>
          <p>Circa January–February 2019, it emerged that a number of software developers were misusing enterprise developer certificates 
          to distribute software directly to non-employees, thereby bypassing the App Store. Facebook was found to be abusing an Apple 
          enterprise developer certificate to distribute an application to underage users that would give Facebook access to all private 
          data on their devices. Google was abusing an Apple enterprise developer certificate to distribute an app to adults 
          to collect data from their devices, including unencrypted data belonging to third parties. TutuApp, Panda Helper, AppValley, 
          and TweakBox have all been abusing enterprise developer certificates to distribute apps that offer pirated software.</p>

          <h3><b>Network Security</h3></b>
          <p>iOS supports TLS with both low- and high-level APIs for developers. By default, the App Transport Security framework requires 
          that servers use at least TLS 1.2. However, developers are free to override this framework and utilize their own methods of 
          communicating over networks. When Wi-Fi is enabled, iOS uses a randomized MAC address so that devices cannot be tracked by anyone 
          sniffing wireless traffic.</p>

          <h3><b>Two-Factor Authentication</h3></b>
          <p>Two-factor authentication is an option in iOS to ensure that even if an unauthorized person knows an Apple ID and password 
          combination, they cannot gain access to the account. It works by requiring not only the Apple ID and password, but also a verification 
          code that is sent to an iDevice or mobile phone number that is already known to be trusted. If an unauthorized user attempts to 
          sign in using another user's Apple ID, the owner of the Apple ID receives a notification that allows them to deny access to the 
          unrecognized device.</p>

          <p>The closed and proprietary nature of iOS has garnered criticism, particularly 
            by digital rights advocates such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, computer 
            engineer and activist Brewster Kahle, Internet-law specialist Jonathan Zittrain, 
            and the Free Software Foundation who protested the iPad's introductory event and 
            have targeted the iPad with their "Defective by Design" campaign. 
            Competitor Microsoft, via a PR spokesman, criticized Apple's control over 
            its platform.</p>

          <p>At issue are restrictions imposed by the design of iOS, namely digital rights 
          management (DRM) intended to lock purchased media to Apple's platform, the development 
          model (requiring a yearly subscription to distribute apps developed for the iOS), the 
          centralized approval process for apps, as well as Apple's general control and lockdown 
          of the platform itself. Particularly at issue is the ability for Apple to remotely 
          disable or delete apps at will.</p>
            
          <p>Some in the tech community have expressed concern that the locked-down iOS represents 
          a growing trend in Apple's approach to computing, particularly Apple's shift away from 
          machines that hobbyists can "tinker with" and note the potential for such restrictions to 
          stifle software innovation.[203][204] Former Facebook developer Joe Hewitt protested against 
          Apple's control over its hardware as a "horrible precedent" but praised iOS's sandboxing of apps.</p>
